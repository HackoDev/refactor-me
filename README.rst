This repository represents a step by step refactoring of a dirty code given me as a test task to
estimate my coding skills. The only remark about the code was:
"`refactor_me.py <https://github.com/dmugtasimov/refactor-me/blob/1036c091cb70ef110b4e56702bdc012c8a110336/refactor_me.py>`_ is expected to
contain Python 3.5.x code" (actually file naming was not provided in the task).

I did it in a way that every commit contains one particular change described in the commit message.
The original dirty code can be found in this commit:
`1036c091cb70ef110b4e56702bdc012c8a110336 <https://github.com/dmugtasimov/refactor-me/tree/1036c091cb70ef110b4e56702bdc012c8a110336>`_

Remarks on final result:

- 100 character line length limit is used on purpose

Please, do not hesitate to submit pull requests for improvements if you feel that I missed
something.
